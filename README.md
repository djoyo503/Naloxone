# Naloxone :hospital: #
On April 14, 2016, British Columbia’s Provincial Health Officer, Dr. Perry Kendall, declared the opioid crisis a public health emergency in B.C. In 2016, 931 British Columbians died from overdoses – 216 of these overdose deaths were in Vancouver. Fentanyl was detected in approximately 60% of those deaths (Coroners Service, 2017). The crisis is continuing in 2017: by the end of March there had already been 347 overdose deaths in B.C. As high as these numbers are, there is evidence that overdoses are under-reported. Overdose fatalities are now the leading cause of unnatural deaths in B.C., and are increasing nationally as the spread of opioid analogues moves east from Western Canada.

Naloxone (also known as Narcan®) is a medication called an “opioid antagonist” used to counter the effects of opioid overdose, for example morphine and heroin overdose. Specifically, naloxone is used in opioid overdoses to counteract life-threatening depression of the central nervous system and respiratory system, allowing an overdose victim to breathe normally.

Naloxone is a cross platform application made to combat the opioid crisis. The idea behind this project is to get Naloxone as quickly as possible to overdosed patients by locating the closest hospitals, pharamcies and Naloxone kit holders with the hopes of increasing their chances of survival.

## Features ##

### Map ###
The map in the application shows the user as well as pharmacies and hospitals within a two kilometer radius. When the user taps on a pharmacy or a hospital icon, the location's information will appear above the location. When the user taps on the location's details, a map application on the device will pop up with directions to the pharmacy/hospital from the user's location.

### Distress Call (in progress) ###
The discress call section within the app has a slide button that allows the user to send out a distress call to nearby users with Naloxone kits within a two kilometer radius. When a Naloxone kit user recieves a distress call, they can either accept or reject this call. The first user to accept the call will be given the location of the user in distress. This part of the application is under construction.
